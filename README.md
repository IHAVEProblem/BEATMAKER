# BEATMAKER

"I expeditiously developed a plugin site for my friend, however, I must acknowledge that there is a significant amount of repetitive code that could benefit from optimization or be rewrited using React. Which I will do soon. Maybe.

THIS SITE IS STILL UNDER CONSTRACTION - the lack of a designer geneually slows the progress, since I spend a lot of time creating UX/UI by myself and then waiting for approval from my friend who is not a designer either and has a "very specific taste" in UI/UXðŸ˜’

So yeah...
